It sounds like you might be referring to **"The Writer"**, an automaton created by Swiss watchmaker **Pierre Jaquet-Droz** in the 1770s. This mechanical marvel, often considered one of the most complex automatons of its time, is designed to look like a small boy sitting at a desk, capable of writing customizable text with a quill pen. It consists of approximately 6,000 parts and uses a programmable system of 40 cams to write up to 40 characters across four lines. The Writer, along with two other automatons by Jaquet-Droz ("The Draughtsman" and "The Musician"), is housed at the **Musée d'Art et d'Histoire** in **Neuchâtel, Switzerland**, where they are still in working order and occasionally demonstrated.

Another possibility could be the **"Silver Swan"**, created in 1773 by **John Joseph Merlin** (a Belgian inventor and clockmaker) in collaboration with **James Cox**. This life-like automaton depicts a swan that moves its neck, preens, and appears to catch a fish, all powered by clockwork mechanisms. It is currently on display at **The Bowes Museum** in Barnard Castle, County Durham, England, and performs daily (with recent restorations completed in 2023-2024).

If neither of these matches what you’re thinking of, there are other notable automatons from the 18th century, such as **Jacques de Vaucanson’s Digesting Duck** (1738) or **Henri Maillardet’s Draughtsman-Writer** (circa 1800), the latter of which is at the **Franklin Institute** in Philadelphia. Maillardet’s automaton, sometimes confused with Jaquet-Droz’s, can draw four pictures and write three poems.

Could you clarify any specific details, like what the robot does (e.g., writes, draws, plays music) or where the museum might be? This would help narrow it down further![](https://www.messynessychic.com/2018/02/21/the-boy-robot-of-1774/)[](https://www.history.com/news/7-early-robots-and-automatons)[](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2488165/The-worlds-Mechanical-boy-built-240-years-ago-engineered-act-writing.html)
